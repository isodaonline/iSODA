SNF is another computational method for integrating different single-omics datasets. SNF works by constructing individual networks for each dataset, each representing the similarity between samples. These networks are then fused into a single network through an iterative process capturing both the shared and unique characteristics of each dataset. For a single-omics dataset, a distance matrix between the samples is created, using the distance method chosen by the user (e.g. Euclidean). The distance matrix is then transformed into an affinity matrix, capturing the local neighborhood relationships among the samples by employing the the K-nearest neighbors and sigma parameters. The former specifies the number of nearest neighbors for each sample based on the distance matrix, and the latter determines how rapidly the affinity between samples decreases when constructing the affinity matrix.  The samples are then grouped into K clusters through spectral clustering. In the case of the fusion heatmap and the similarity fusion network, the affinity matrices of each individual omics are combined, using the additional K-nearest neighbors parameter and a designated number of iterations (T) for the diffusion process, thereby enhancing the comprehensive understanding of the dataset through a multifaceted approach.  

**Similarity Heatmap**: This heatmap illustrates the impact of spectral clustering on omics datasets separately. The x-axis and y-axis display samples organized by cluster groups, while the cell values indicate affinity levels. Cluster assignments can be shown as side annotations alongside other sample characteristics, enabling evaluation of whether the clustering within single-omics data aligns with anticipated sample groupings.  

**Fusion Heatmap**: This heatmap presents sample affinities by integrating multiple omics datasets. Users can select two or more single-omics datasets, which are each subjected to spectral clustering. The outcomes are then merged to form a comprehensive affinity matrix that encapsulates the characteristics of the integrated omics data. Like the similarity heatmap, this heatmap organizes samples according to their cluster affiliations and allows for the mapping of sample annotations. The fusion heatmap is particularly useful for identifying sample similarities that emerge when multiple data perspectives are considered simultaneously.  

**Similarity Network**: This network graph visualizes the affinity matrix for single-omics datasets. The similarity matrix is converted into a network, where all samples are connected by edges that denote the affinity values between them. To enhance readability, the network is trimmed to retain only the highest-scoring edges, a percentage which can be set by the user. Nodes are color-coded based on cluster affiliation or other sample annotations, and edge thickness is proportional to the affinity value. By interactively hovering over nodes and edges, additional details will be displayed on screen. This network serves as an alternative to the similarity heatmap, enabling users to verify whether the clustering of single-omics data corresponds with predefined sample groups and to explore complex relationships like affinities across multiple sample groups.  

**Similarity Fusion Network**: This network graph represents the multi-omics sample clustering, employing the same approach as the single-omics similarity network but based on the fusion heatmap. Users can select two or more single-omics datasets, and the combined affinity matrix is then transformed into a network. Here again, the user can select the top scoring edges to be displayed. The edge width corresponds to the affinity values, while the coloring denotes the number of omics datasets supporting each connection, based on the set edge threshold. This network is interpreted like the single-omics network, with the added benefit of sourcing the connections from multiple datasets. The similarity fusion network is particularly effective in revealing groupings less apparent in single-omics analyses. It also identifies unique connections that emerge only when multiple omics datasets are considered together.
