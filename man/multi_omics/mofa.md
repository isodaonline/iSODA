MOFA is an unsupervised integration method designed to reduce the complexity of large-scale omics datasets into a manageable number of latent factors (Z). These factors capture the underlying sources of variation across the datasets, providing insights into biological processes that might be driving the observed patterns. Factors can be assimilated to principal components in PCA, each explaining a portion of the variance from the dataset. Similarly, samples and features have weights (W) associated to each factor.  

**Explained Variance Plot**: This plot provides an overview of the contribution of each omics dataset to the computed factors by displaying the variance explained for each factor in the form of a heatmap. Additionally, two bar plots on the sides show the cumulative variance for each omics and each factor. This arrangement allows researchers to identify factors unique to specific omics as well as those that are significant contributors across multiple omics, potentially indicating a shared biological phenomenon. The plot serves as a useful reference in conjunction with other plots to identify the most relevant factors for the omics under investigation.  

**Factor Plot**: This plot summarizes the sample factor weights and assesses their potential to explain group differences. It displays samples on the x-axis and their corresponding factor weights on the y-axis. Multiple factors can be represented simultaneously, with samples differentiated according to sample annotations. Optional violin plots give a better impression of sample distributions. By mapping sample annotations, researchers can determine whether certain factors distinctly separate specific sample groups. These factors may then be analyzed in greater detail using additional visualizations.  

**Combined Factors Plot**: This visualization complements the factor plot by showing whether paired factors explain variations between sample groups. One or multiple factors can be selected, which generates a grid containing two types of plots. Plots on the diagonal illustrate the distribution of samples across the loadings of a single factor, while off-diagonal plots depict the distribution across two factors. Density plots are used to visualize group distributions and to assess whether factors explain differences between sample groups. Additionally, the combined factor scatter plots enable the examination of whether sample groups can be characterized by more than one factor, similar to how PCA plots sample scores for two components.  

**Feature Weights Plot**: This plot illustrates the contributions of individual features to a selected factor within a specified omics dataset. Users select a factor and omics dataset, and the features are displayed with their factor weights on the x-axis and their contribution rank on the y-axis. Typically, features will align along a sigmoid curve, or alternatively, a logarithmic curve when absolute factor weights are considered. This format allows users to quickly identify the most influential features at either end of the sigmoid curve or at the peak of the logarithmic curve. Additionally, mapping feature annotations can provide deeper insights into which groups of features significantly influence the factor.  

**Feature Top Weights Plot**: This plot serves as an alternative to the feature weights plot, focusing specifically on the highest-scoring features. Users select an omics-factor pair, and the plot displays the top contributing features in a lollipop plot. Contributions can be further filtered to show either the top negative or positive contributing features, enabling a more targeted analysis of feature impact.  

**MOFA Heatmap**: This visualization integrates the single-omics heatmap approach with the identification of a factor's top contributing features. Similar to the heatmap available in the single omics module, the MOFA heatmap presents the measured data and provides clustering for both samples and features. Unlike the standard heatmap, which employs supervised discriminant analysis for feature selection, the MOFA heatmap selects the top-ranked features based on their factor contributions, regardless of whether these are negative or positive. This enables the user to view if certain sample groups can be distinguished by the most relevant features of a factor. If no distinct groups are apparent, it may indicate that the factor is associated with an overlooked biological process.  

**Scatter Plot**: This plot enables users to assess the correlation between specific feature signals and the dataset’s sample weights. Users can select an omics dataset along with the top contributing features to a factor—whether negative, positive, or both. A grid of scatter plots is then generated, each representing a distinct feature. In each scatter plot, samples are plotted with their measured values for that feature on the y-axis and their sample weights on the x-axis. A Pearson correlation coefficient and a confidence interval are calculated and displayed for each plot to quantify the strength and certainty of the correlation. Sample annotations can be mapped to visually emphasize different sample groups. This scatter plot provides a detailed examination of how the measured top-weighted features correlate with sample weights, possibly explaining sample groups.
